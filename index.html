            Name: <input type="test" name="name"/>
            E-mail: <input type="email" name="email"/>

        <p>We have to run this page with file-protocol, since the webserver is not yet set up for showing a HTML-page</p>
        <p>Look at '2-1.txt' for log details. We don't have a query string with the submitted data, but I'm quite sure we can extract it - <br>
            I'm just not sure how to do so :-) <br>
            I would believe it's in the body of the request, so something like this 'req.body.name'
